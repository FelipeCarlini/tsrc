# Adding new features

You are free to open a pull request on Github for any feature you'd like.

Note that for your merge request to be accepted, we'll ask that

* All existing linters pass
* All existing tests run
* The new feature comes with appropriate tests

See the [.travis.yml file](https://github.com/TankerApp/tsrc/blob/master/.travis.yml)
to see what exactly what commands are run and the Python versions we
support.
